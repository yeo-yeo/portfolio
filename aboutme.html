        I'm Gillian, a recent graduate of the
        <a href="https://www.foundersandcoders.com/">Founders and Coders</a>
        full-stack bootcamp. I'm currently looking for full-stack or back-end
        developer opportunities.
      </p>
      <p class="bio">
        Before moving into tech, I spent 4 years in finance in London and
        Bermuda and 2 years teaching English in sunny Rome. While working in
        finance I did a lot of large-scale spreadsheet modelling which was a
        sort of introduction to coding. It gave me a lot of insight into how
        business processes and technology are integrated, and how in traditional
        industries there is room for improvement.
      </p>
      <p class="bio">
        I have a First Class degree from the University of Edinburgh in English
        Literature and Latin. While it might not be the 100% traditional
        background for a developer, I think the literary and linguistic
        analsysis, and rigorous application of grammar and syntax in Latin are
        actually a perfect preparation for programming.
      </p>
      <p class="bio">
        I'm looking forward to honing my development skills in a team
        environment, while bringing my previously developed skills to the table
        too. Hope to see you soon!
