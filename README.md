My portfolio with bio, past projects and contact details

Things I've learned in the process of building my portfolio:
* Keeping things simple! I was initially working on something much more complicated which I eventually scrapped 
* React refs
* Updated state not available in event handlers (closure!)
* Domain management
* Downloading and installing custom fonts
